This is one of the first attempts to create a production model based on the GPT style algorithm!!!!
<br>
<br>
Everyone thinks that GPT can only write fancy text but...
<br>
<br>
GPT is a few shot learner algorithm! It's able to deeply understand a NLP task with few examples, allowing us to speed up complex problems in a few lines of prompt!
<br>
<br>
News Analytics is our first proof of concept. We designed a prompt which can extract the number of people affected by an incident and the location from news. It seems like an easy task but try to explain it to a computer!
<br>
We explained it to GPT ;)
<br>
