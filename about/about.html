This is one of the first attempts to create a production-ready system based on a GPT-like model!!!!
<br>
<br>
Everyone thinks that GPT-like models can only write fancy text but...
<br>
<br>
GPT-based models are few shot learners! They are able to deeply understand a NLP task with few examples, allowing us to speed up complex problems in a few lines of prompt!
<br>
<br>
{{ site.name }} is our first proof of concept. We designed a prompt which can extract the number of people affected by an incident and the site from news. It seems like an easy task but try to explain it to a computer!
<br>
We explained it to a GPT-like model ;)
<br>
